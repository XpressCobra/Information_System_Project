## Project Proposal

> Why you're choosing this game

I chose to write and illustrate my final project on one of my favorite games, Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege. I'm choosing Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6 Siege for its excellent and intense tactical gameplay. Whether I'm playing locally with friends or battling with foes from around the world over the Internet, there's no denying the strategic and tactical depth present in the game. Matches are tense, and each round feels like it's coming down to the wire. The unique operators, with each bringing different special abilities, add to the depth of playstyles required for success. Despite being released in 2015, Rainbow 6 Siege has shown no signs of slowing down, with a vibrant and active community still going strong. As of 4 years ago, I’ve been playing this game. The game has always been one of my favorites purely for its simplicity and intense action. Whether it be late at night with the boys playing until sunrise, or playing alone listening to music just enjoy my peace and quiet. There's no other shooter experience like Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6 Siege. 



Scenario/Summary

 This game is a first-person shooter multiplayer strategy gun game. Two teams of five players are placed on a battlefield (also known as a map) and are forced to play objectively for victory. One team are defender, whereas the other team is the attacker. The defenders start within a secure place (like a house) and the attackers wait outside. As defenders, your job is to protect a bomb from your opposition (being the attackers). The defense has 30 seconds to prepare for an attack before the attackers spawn. Using communication and teamwork, each team uses different strategies to defend or attack. Once the attacker reaches the bomb they must plant a device in order to start the bomb counter. After 30 seconds after the plant, the defenders must deactivate the bomb to win, while the attackers try to prevent that. The attacking team wins by exploding the bomb and the defending team wins by deactivating the plant or when the time runs out. Both teams can also win if the opposite team's players have all been killed. Each game is set to 3 rounds while swapping teams from defender or attacker roles. Before each round, each player on each team must choose an operator who gives them specific guns and abilities. Each operator is unique. On attacking you have a set of over a dozen attacking specific operators. When defending you also have a set of over a dozen defending operators. Defending operators are more helpful in defending rooms and are usually heavier. In contrast, attackers are lighter and fast. After each person has chosen an operator, the defenders must vote on a location on the map to defend. The attackers then chose a spawn point. After each round, the roles are reversed for each team (attackers turn to defenders and vice-versa) and choosing characters restarts. Once an enemy on the opposing team is eliminated they must wait and spectate until the next round. Being dead also gives you the chance to use drones and cameras to help your teammates out. Finally, I would like to use this game as my final project, as it may be difficult, I will attempt to do my best.
